Data on the number of passengers embarking and disembarking in train stations.

Data published originally in Tapuz public transport forum. We know it comes from Israel Railway but we don't know how it's calculated (ticket sales? ticket barriers? something else?)

Open train has an archive of Excel files from the forum [here](http://otrain.org/files/count/).
